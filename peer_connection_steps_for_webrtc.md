# WebRTC Peer Connection Establishment

The WebRTC specification defines a specific order of operations for establishing a peer connection between two devices. This README provides a detailed explanation of each step in the process.

## Introduction

The WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) specification outlines a standardized process for establishing peer-to-peer connections between browsers or devices. This process ensures that both peers can communicate audio, video, and data streams effectively.

## Order of Operations

### Creating an Offer (Local Description)

The process begins when one peer decides to initiate a connection. This peer creates an offer, which includes details about its media capabilities, such as supported codecs, bandwidth constraints, and network information. The offer is represented using the Session Description Protocol (SDP). The SDP offer describes the configuration of the peer's media streams.

### Setting the Local Description

Once the offer is created, the initiating peer sets the offer as its local description. This involves associating the SDP offer with the peer connection object in the WebRTC API. Setting the local description prepares the peer to initiate communication with the remote peer and establishes the parameters for the upcoming session.

### Sending the Offer to the Remote Peer

After setting the local description, the initiating peer sends the SDP offer to the remote peer using a signaling mechanism. The signaling mechanism can vary and is typically implemented using protocols like WebSocket, HTTP, or a custom signaling server. The offer is transmitted along with any metadata necessary for establishing the connection, such as ICE candidates (network addresses) gathered by the peer.

### Receiving an Answer (Remote Description) from the Remote Peer

Upon receiving the offer, the remote peer processes the SDP offer and creates its own SDP answer. The answer includes information about the remote peer's media capabilities and network configuration, which complement the details provided in the offer. The remote peer sets the SDP answer as its remote description.

### Setting the Remote Description

Finally, the remote peer sets the SDP answer as its remote description. This step completes the process of establishing the peer connection. By setting the remote description, the remote peer acknowledges the offer and establishes a common set of parameters for the communication session. The peer connection object now contains both local and remote descriptions, enabling bidirectional communication between the peers.
